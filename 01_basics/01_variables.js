// Notes
// Imagine you have a toy box. You want to put some toys in it and play with them later.

// üß∏ var ‚Äî Old Toy Box
// Long ago, kids used var to make toy boxes. But this box had a little problem:
// Even if you said, "Hey, I want this toy only inside my room," it still goes around the whole house! üò±
// Also, if you say "I want a new toy with the same name," it says, "Okay!" and replaces the old one without warning. üò¨

// So:

// var ignores room rules (called block scope).

// var lets you make new boxes with the same name (called redeclaration).

// üß∏ let ‚Äî New & Smarter Toy Box
// Now, kids use let because it listens better!
// If you say, "I want this toy only inside my room," it says, "Got it!"
// And if you try to make a toy with the same name in the same room, it says, "Nope! You already have one!" üëç

// So:

// let stays in the room you told it to.

// let doesn‚Äôt let you make another toy with the same name in the same room.
